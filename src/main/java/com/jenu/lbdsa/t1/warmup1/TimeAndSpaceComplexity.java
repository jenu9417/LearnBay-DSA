Time complexity is the measure of how the running time of a program 
varies with respect to input.

Space complexity is the measure of how the auxiliary space consumption 
of a program varies with respect to input.

Generally, both time complexity and space complexity is denoted using 
Big-Oh notation which indicates the worst case performance.
